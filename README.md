# hello-world
practice repository

This is a "readme" text file in the hello-world practice repository.
We are going to try using this repository for practice with git commands.
Language is borrowed from 
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
which is also a great learning resource.

Create a branch of the GreetingsFromEveryone file.  Then edit it and put your own greeting in it with your name.

Once you are done, "commit" your changes either with a command (if using terminal), 
the button at the bottom of the page (if using the web interface), or using
the tools in the desktop (if using the desktop client).  
For practice, write a short commit message that describes your changes-- maybe just
your name (not important here, but a good habit to practice if collaborating on code or a document).

Now you have saved changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.
When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.
